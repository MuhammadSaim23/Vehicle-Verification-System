            <p >The Honda Civic has a reputation built on 50 years of affordability, efficiency and durability, and the 2022 redesign looks to keep that tradition going strong. This 11th-generation Civic gets a thorough makeover inside and out. Some may say the new Civic's more conventional design is boring compared to the previous model's flamboyance, but we contend it's cleaner and more refined.Honda has redesigned the Civic for 2022, bringing this endearing compact sedan and hatchback into its 11th generation. Honda left no stone unturned, updating everything from the Civic's body structure and engines to its design and safety features. As with its predecessors, the 2022 Honda Civic aims to provide affordable, reliable, efficient motoring for the masses. If the 2022 Civic is as practical and fun to drive as the last-gen car, the new Honda should have no trouble maintaining its spot as one of the best-selling cars.</p>

            <p> BMW’s mission statement is “to become the world’s leading provider of premium products and premium services for individual mobility.” The statement shows that BMW has come of age and no longer settles on normal or what can be defined as satisfactory products. Instead, the company goes beyond this expectation to bring first-class cars, and that explains why the German corporation is held in high ostentation across the globe.BMW’s mission statement is “to become the world’s leading provider of premium products and premium services for individual mobility.” The statement shows that BMW has come of age and no longer settles on normal or what can be defined as satisfactory products.
